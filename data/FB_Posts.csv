The apostle Paul writes about leaving behind his old ways and the status he once valued for the immeasurable good of knowing and belonging to Jesus. In his gospel, John reminds us that the path from the old to the new involves Jesus’s death.

The essay examines a biblical parable about a fig tree that hasn't produced fruit and a gardener who refuses to cut it down but instead wants to let it live one more year.

""Like the gardener in the parable, God is patient and merciful with everything he cultivates,"" Dean Powery says. ""Even now, I can hear God speaking as a Great Gardener to us: 'Give it one more year. I’m not giving up on you. Let’s try one more phone call. Let’s try one more intervention. Let’s try one more therapy session. Let’s try one more gym workout. Let’s try one more surgery. Let’s try one more attempt at reconciliation and healing. Let’s try one more attempt at peace talks. You matter.'”

""Don’t give up even if you are on a fruitless streak and others want to cut you down,"" he says. ""Listen for a whisper of hope: One more year!""

In this video, senior Caroline Gamard tells her faith-and-learning story at Duke.

Caroline Gamard, T '22, came to a Duke Chapel service as a freshman but didn't think she would come back until she discovered a faith community through the Chapel Scholars program and also with the Duke Episcopal Center. Having begun a major in chemistry, when the pandemic hit, Gamard was left with lots of time to ponder her purpose in life. 

""That's where the Chapel and where these faith communities really came into play,"" she says about conversations she had with Chapel and Episcopal Center ministers. ""One of the reasons I was originally in chemistry was that I wanted to go into pharmacology and drug design because I was really drawn to this idea of healing through making better drugs, but I realized I really wanted to be part of that healing process with people one-on-one.""

""All of the that helped me figure out that I really wanted to a psychologist and work in mental health care,"" she said. ""One thing that I want to do in my work is open these spaces for people to come exactly as they are and be authentic and be validated, and I feel like I learned about those spaces by occupying them at the Episcopal Center, at the Chapel.""

Now majoring in psychology, the senior from Fairhope, Alabama, says, ""This was my life speaking to me; this was God telling me, 'This who I made you to be.'""

He describes four commonalities: being part of team or community, having a discipline of practice, navigating wins and losses/up and downs, and seeking faithfulness and persistence rather than perfection.

""Any of Duke’s coaches can tell you about how student-athletes are formed as people through participation in competitive sports,"" he writes. ""But it’s not a quick fix; it’s a journey. The same is true of the spiritual life.""

""We are running a marathon, not a sprint. Patience is a virtue,"" he says. ""As the Bible’s Letter to the Hebrews puts it: we 'run with perseverance the race that is set before us.'”

The students, who came from a variety of religious backgrounds and worldviews, spent the day in reflection about what it means to understand land as a space for spiritual, relational, and ecological renewal. They received a tour from K Cox and Kisha Jeffries, the stewards of Respite. They also spent time exploring, reflecting, resting on their own.

Anyone interested in future interfaith programming for graduate students, please contact Rev. Kathryn Lester-Bacon, the Chapel's director of Religious Life.

God of Justice, God of Peace,
We pray for the people of Ukraine,
and for all of Europe that watches with bated breath the war that has ensued.
We pray for diplomats and politicians
and for every soldier and civilian caught up in the tension of conflict and strife.
In your kingdom, weapons of war are made into tools for harvest;
in our world we pray that weapons of violence would be laid down
and tools of peace would be picked up.
We pray for those who have power to make decisions that spill blood or prevent it.
We pray for all who are lost in the mayhem of political gamesmanship, lives tossed and turned.
Finally, we pray for all people in harm’s way, who fear for their safety and future,
that your grace would hold and protect them.
In Jesus’s name we pray. Amen.",48,"02/24/2022 14:03",N/A,https://www.facebook.com/DukeChapel/videos/442253741015411/,0,0,Videos,,,,,Lifetime,4616,438,311,57,70,231,29297.207,5.907,0,0,0,175,56,,,,

The commissioned exhibition takes its inspiration from a scene in a book by Duke Divinity School Professor Kate Bowler. In ""No Cure for Being Human (And Other Truths I Need to Hear),"" Professor Bowler describes being on a trip to the Grand Canyon when she comes upon a remote chapel that is covered in graffiti and slips of paper inserted in the walls with written pleas from the heart, such as “I miss you every day” and “Did you make it to heaven, my love?” Likewise in her work, Tinsely creates a vessel for a viewer’s own thoughts, stories, and complicated truths.

He says these items call him to remember people who are suffering. They also remind him to work for healing—""re-membering""—in the world.

""The physical memorial on my desk calls me to remember love and to re-member through love, no matter how hard it is to 'do this' these days,"" he writes. ""What better way to remember Trayvon and Jesus than to love because true love conquers death.""

Powery is a contributor to the new book ""Shouting Above the Noisy Crowd: Biblical Wisdom and the Urgency of Preaching"" from Wipf and Stock Publishers, a collection of essays from leaders in the field of homiletics offering wisdom on the art of preaching.

In his chapter on “Is Preaching Political?”, Dean Powery explains how preaching is inescapably political because of its theological foundation.
 
“The incarnation of God in Jesus was God’s political act or political sermon in that God entered the sphere of public human affairs,” he writes. God passes over the powerful leaders of Jesus’s time in order reveal himself in a baby born on the margins of the Roman empire. “Rooted in this understanding of the incarnation of God in Christ, one can say that not only is Jesus the Word of God political but the gospel he preaches in word and deed is a political act as well.”

“Vocation is not about a goal I pursue but a calling or voice that I hear; it has to do with listening,” Dean Powery writes. “Your purpose, your ‘why,’ is also about speaking.”

“The process of living into your ‘why’ is not necessarily a linear path but will most likely be a zigzag road,” he says.

“Listen for a voice that will lead you out into the deep,” he writes. “You might say, ‘I can’t,’ but the voice calling you out into the deep waters of joyous purpose says, ‘Yes, you can.’”

Chaos or Community?'] on the world house, 'We are inevitably our brother’s keeper because we are our brother’s brother. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.'”

""The purpose of King’s life--his 'why' for living--was to call for an ecumenical worldwide fellowship of love,"" he writes. ""King was willing to die for his 'why.' What is your 'why'? What is your purpose?""

4804673246238231,202916306413971,"Duke University Chapel","Today members of the Sikh community celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh (represented in the image below). Here is a brief explanation from the Duke Sikh Society about the importance of Guru Singh in the Sikh faith:

Guru (""Teacher"") Gobind Singh was born in India in 1666 and is regarded as a linguist, poet, warrior and philosopher who institutionalized the Sikhs as a formal, stand-alone religion in 1699. The Guru penned widely acclaimed pieces of literature such as the Zafarnama and the Dasam Granth—and is also known for having compiled the authoritative version of the Guru Granth Sahib (main religious text of the Sikhs). Moreover, he created the Khalsa (an all-volunteer Sikh army), which was crucial in protecting Sikhs and Indians from persecution after his death and in the nine subsequent invasions of India. One of his quotes—""Recognize the whole human race as one""—is now the motto of the largest Sikh-led NGO in the world, Khalsa Aid.
