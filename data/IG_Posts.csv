⠀
Guru (""Teacher"") Gobind Singh was born in India in 1666 and is regarded as a linguist, poet, warrior and philosopher who institutionalized the Sikhs as a formal, stand-alone religion in 1699. The Guru penned widely acclaimed pieces of literature such as the Zafarnama and the Dasam Granth—and is also known for having compiled the authoritative version of the Guru Granth Sahib (main religious text of the Sikhs). Moreover, he created the Khalsa (an all-volunteer Sikh army), which was crucial in protecting Sikhs and Indians from persecution after his death and in the nine subsequent invasions of India. One of his quotes—""Recognize the whole human race as one""—is now the motto of the largest Sikh-led NGO in the world, Khalsa Aid.⠀

“Vocation is not about a goal I pursue but a calling or voice that I hear; it has to do with listening,” Dean Powery writes. “Your purpose, your ‘why,’ is also about speaking.”

“The process of living into your ‘why’ is not necessarily a linear path but will most likely be a zigzag road,” he says.

“Listen for a voice that will lead you out into the deep,” he writes. “You might say, ‘I can’t,’ but the voice calling you out into the deep waters of joyous purpose says, ‘Yes, you can.’”

""That's where the Chapel and where these faith communities really came into play,"" she says about conversations she had with Chapel and Episcopal Center ministers. ""One of the reasons I was originally in chemistry was that I wanted to go into pharmacology and drug design because I was really drawn to this idea of healing through making better drugs, but I realized I really wanted to be part of that healing process with people one-on-one.""

""All of the that helped me figure out that I really wanted to a psychologist and work in mental health care,"" she said. ""One thing that I want to do in my work is open these spaces for people to come exactly as they are and be authentic and be validated, and I feel like I learned about those spaces by occupying them at the Episcopal Center, at the Chapel.""

The essay examines a biblical parable about a fig tree that hasn't produced fruit and a gardener who refuses to cut it down but instead wants to let it live one more year.

""Like the gardener in the parable, God is patient and merciful with everything he cultivates,"" Dean Powery says. ""Even now, I can hear God speaking as a Great Gardener to us: 'Give it one more year. I’m not giving up on you. Let’s try one more phone call. Let’s try one more intervention. Let’s try one more therapy session. Let’s try one more gym workout. Let’s try one more surgery. Let’s try one more attempt at reconciliation and healing. Let’s try one more attempt at peace talks. You matter.'”

""Don’t give up even if you are on a fruitless streak and others want to cut you down,"" he says. ""Listen for a whisper of hope: One more year!""

The prophet Isaiah proclaims God’s plan to do a new thing bringing life in places that are destitute and dry. The apostle Paul writes about leaving behind his old ways and the status he once valued for the immeasurable good of knowing and belonging to Jesus. In his gospel, John reminds us that the path from the old to the new involves Jesus’s death.
