Here is a brief explanation from the Duke Sikh Society about the importance of Guru Singh in the Sikh faith:\n\nGuru (\"Teacher\") Gobind Singh was born in India in 1666 and is regarded as a linguist, poet, warrior and philosopher who institutionalized the Sikhs as a formal, stand-alone religion in 1699. The Guru penned widely acclaimed pieces of literature such as the Zafarnama and the Dasam Granth\u2014and is also known for having compiled the authoritative version of the Guru Granth Sahib (main religious text of the Sikhs). Moreover, he created the Khalsa (an all-volunteer Sikh army), which was crucial in protecting Sikhs and Indians from persecution after his death and in the nine subsequent invasions of India.
